## Introduction
  Sentiment analysis is crucial for interpreting textual data, with applications across various domains such as business insights, market research, customer support, social media monitoring, political analysis, content moderation, and financial forecasting.

### Research Focus : Investigates various sentiment analysis methodologies from traditional rule-based approaches to advanced deep learning techniques.

### Dataset : Utilizes the Sentiment140 dataset to compare traditional TF-IDF with fine-tuned DistilBERT.

### Models Compared : Compares Logistic Regression (LR), Linear Support Vector Classification (Linear SVC), and DistilBERT for sentiment analysis.

### Model Architectures : Provides details on DistilBERTâ€™s architecture for sequence classification.

### Evaluation Metrics : Evaluates models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

### Performance Results:
####     - Logistic Regression: 82% accuracy, TP: 41.9%, FP: 9.05%, FN: 8.11%.
####    - Linear SVC: 83% accuracy, TP: 41.37%, FP: 9.51%, FN: 8.64%.
####    - DistilBERT: 86% accuracy, superior in determining sentence sentiment probabilities.

### Key Insights : Highlights the importance of additional layers in model performance and the strength of deep learning in handling nuanced emotions.

### Conclusion : Showcases how deep learning, particularly DistilBERT, advances sentiment analysis methodologies by providing superior performance and handling nuanced emotions effectively.
